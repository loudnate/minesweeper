minesweeper
===========

A client-side minesweeper clone. This was partly for fun, and partly as a
learning experience with:
* jQuery, which I haven't used in 2.5 years
* Handlebars, which I'm pleased with.
* Bootstrap, which is excessive and not for production use.
* 3D Transform stacking contexts
* Google Drive publishing
* Markdown
